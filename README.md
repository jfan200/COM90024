```

* manage.py: Django management tool used for running the development server and executing management commands.
* mainapp/: Directory containing the main application, including models, views, and URL configuration.
* Backend/: Root directory of the Django project, including project configuration files and URL configuration.
* venv/: Virtual environment directory for isolating project dependencies and environment.
* Dockerfile: Configuration file for building the Docker container.
* requirements.txt: Lists the project dependencies.

### Quick Start
1. Ensure that you have Docker installed.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in the command line.
3. Build the Docker container:
```cmd
docker build -t backend-app .
```
4.Run the Docker container:
```python
docker run -p 8000:8000 backend-app
```
The project will run on port 8000 inside the container and can be accessed via port 8000 on the host machine.


### Configuration
* The project's configuration file is located at Backend/settings.py, where you can customize the configuration as per your requirements, such as database settings, security settings, logging, etc.
* You can customize the run configuration of the Docker container by modifying the CMD command in the Dockerfile.
